# FastML With EDA Web App

FastML With EDA Web App is a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit that complements the FastML_With_EDA Python package. It empowers users to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and machine learning model training effortlessly. Whether you are a data scientist, analyst, or machine learning enthusiast, this web app simplifies your data-driven tasks.

## Features

- **Data Loading:** Easily upload and load datasets in various formats, including CSV, Excel, XLSX, XLS, and SQL databases.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gain insights into your dataset with summary statistics, data type analysis, unique values in categorical columns, and missing value identification.
- **Missing Value Handling:** Choose from multiple strategies for handling missing data, such as mean or median imputation or complete removal of rows/columns.
- **Outlier Detection:** Detect and optionally remove outliers from numerical columns.
- **Data Visualization:** Generate a wide range of data visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, regression plots, and more, to better understand your data.
- **Categorical Encoding:** Encode categorical features using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.
- **AutoML Model Training:** Train machine learning models for both regression and classification tasks with optional feature scaling. It supports various algorithms, including linear regression, logistic regression, SVM, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and XGBoost.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate trained models with common metrics like R2-score, MSE, RMSE, MAE for regression, and Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix for classification.
- **Model Selection:** Automatically select the best-performing model based on your chosen evaluation metric.

## Usage

1. **Upload Data:** Begin by uploading your dataset (CSV, Excel, XLSX, XLS, or SQL).

2. **Exploration:** Explore your data, identify unique values in categorical columns, and check for missing values.

3. **Missing Value Handling:** Choose a strategy to handle missing values.

4. **Outlier Detection:** Detect and remove outliers if needed.

5. **Data Visualization:** Create various data visualizations to explore relationships in your data.

6. **Categorical Encoding:** Encode categorical features for machine learning.

7. **Machine Learning:** Train machine learning models for regression or classification tasks. You can choose from various models and customize hyperparameters.

8. **Model Comparison:** Compare model performance metrics and select the best model.
